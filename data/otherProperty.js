    description: "A prefabricated building, informally a prefab, is a building that is manufactured and constructed using prefabrication. It consists of factory-made components or units that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.Prefabricated structures, or prefabs, are buildings with components (walls, roof, and floor) that are manufactured in a factory or manufacturing plant. These components can be fully or partially assembled in a factory which is then transferred at the construction site. This method of building construction is preferred due to its cost efficiency, fast turnaround, and reusability. Common applications of prefabricated buildings are temporary construction facilities, office spaces, medical camps, evacuation centers, schools, apartment blocks, and single-detached houses.",

It can be used for roof systems, floor systems, wall systems, roof panels, decks, or the entire buildings. They can also be used as individual framing members such as studs, joists, headers, and truss members.It is an innovative and reliable construction material in the world that is strong and allows design flexibility enabling it to be the right choice for construction. This method of construction allows having an increased span, custom openings, curved walls and a variety of external architectural façade treatments, making it a versatile choice of construction material.

    name: "Sandwich Panels",
    description: "A sandwich panel is any structure made of three layers: a low-density core (PIR, mineral wool, XPS), and a thin skin-layer bonded to each side. Sandwich panels are used in applications where a combination of high structural rigidity and low weight is required. Basically it is a product used to clad the walls and roofs of buildings. Each panel comprises a core of thermo insulating material, skinned on both sides with sheet metal. Sandwich panels are not structural materials but curtain materials. The structural forces are carried by the steel framework or other carrier frame to which the sandwich panels are attached. MAIN FEATURE OF THE SANDWCH PANEL IS - Sandwich panels, protecting you against the external factors on all sides of your building, are produced by filling in a thick and low density insulation material between two thin and high density metal surfaces. These ready-assembled building elements, which have a high load carrying capacity despite their own low weight, are produced on continuous lines. ",
