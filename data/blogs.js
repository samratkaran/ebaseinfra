It is a technology that allows you to control your home devices automatically or remotely. You can define and trigger automatic functions for devices like lighting, security, and appliances through rules, scenes or schedules. Rules make a device respond to a certain scenario or an action of yours. For example, a light in your room turns on when you open the door. Scenes let you group devices so that each of them performs a particular action when the scene is triggered. Schedules allow you to pre-define a device’s function in certain ways at certain times. For instance, you can schedule the lights in the hall to turn on at dusk. Thus, home automation helps control the working of devices with minimum human intervention. It makes your life more convenient and helps save various costs. ",
